The Result Images from Part 1 of the code are informative.  The curve shapes are relatively similar state by state.  Most states had a relatively linear
increase in Covid Deaths from January 2020 through July 2020.  The amount of deaths varied from state to state though, no surprise.  

See the comments on the images of the Code 2 Results to understand what type of analysis was done here.
The Result Images from Part 2 of the code show that if other countries tested a similar percentage of people to the US, how many Covid Cases would they have.
This isn't a complete analysis because many other variables should be considered.  However, with similar testing amounts, the US appeared to have lower covid 
cases than underdeveloped countries, but higher covid cases than other developed countries like itself.
